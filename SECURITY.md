## Security Best Practices for Users

When using Smart TV packages:

### 1. Keep Dependencies Updated

```bash
# Check for outdated packages
pnpm outdated

# Update packages
pnpm update
```

### 2. Validate Content Sources

When using the player package, ensure content sources are trusted:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good - validate source
const isValidSource = (url: string) => {
  const allowedDomains = ["your-cdn.com", "trusted-source.com"];
  const urlObj = new URL(url);
  return allowedDomains.includes(urlObj.hostname);
};

if (isValidSource(videoUrl)) {
  // Load video
}

// ‚ùå Bad - load any URL without validation
player.load(userProvidedUrl);
```

### 3. Content Security Policy (CSP)

Implement proper CSP headers when using Smart TV packages:

```html
<meta
  http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
  content="default-src 'self'; 
               media-src 'self' https://trusted-cdn.com; 
               script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval';"
/>
```

### 4. Sanitize User Input

Always sanitize user input before using it in queries or player metadata:

```typescript
import DOMPurify from "dompurify";

const sanitizedTitle = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);
```

### 5. Secure API Keys

Never expose API keys in client-side code:

```typescript
// ‚ùå Bad
const API_KEY = "sk_live_12345...";

// ‚úÖ Good - use environment variables and proxy through backend
const response = await fetch("/api/content", {
  headers: { Authorization: "Bearer <token from backend>" },
});
```

### 6. Audit Dependencies

Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities:

```bash
pnpm audit
```

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:

- Published in the CHANGELOG.md
- Announced in GitHub Security Advisories
- Tagged with version number following semantic versioning

## Scope

This security policy applies to:

- `@smart-tv/player`
- `@smart-tv/query`
- `create-smart-tv-app`
- All code in the `smart-tv` repository

## Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services
- Only interact with accounts they own or with explicit permission from the account holder
- Do not exploit a security issue beyond the minimal amount necessary to prove it exists
