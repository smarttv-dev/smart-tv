## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/smarttv-dev/smart-tv/issues) as you might find that you don't need to create one.

When creating a bug report, include:

- **Clear title and description**
- **Steps to reproduce** the behavior
- **Expected vs actual behavior**
- **Screenshots** if applicable
- **Environment details** (OS, Node version, browser)
- **Additional context** or logs

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Provide a detailed description** of the suggested enhancement
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful**
- **List any alternatives you've considered**

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? Look for issues labeled:

- `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Extra attention needed
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

Always create a new branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

Branch naming conventions:

- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test additions or modifications
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow the [coding standards](#coding-standards)
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Type checking
pnpm check-types

# Linting
pnpm lint

# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Test in demo app
cd apps/demo
pnpm dev
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```bash
git commit -m "feat(player): add subtitle support"
git commit -m "fix(query): resolve cache invalidation issue"
git commit -m "docs: update installation instructions"
```

Commit types:

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test additions or modifications
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `perf`: Performance improvements

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

Then create a pull request on GitHub.

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Enable strict mode
- Avoid `any` types when possible
- Export types/interfaces for public APIs

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Use meaningful component and prop names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex components

### Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting:

```bash
# Check linting
pnpm lint

# Format code
pnpm format
```

### File Naming

- Components: `PascalCase.tsx`
- Utilities: `camelCase.ts`
- Hooks: `useCamelCase.ts`
- Types: `types.ts` or `ComponentName.types.ts`

### Import Order

1. External dependencies
2. Internal packages
3. Relative imports
4. Types
5. Styles

```typescript
import React from "react";
import { SomeExternalLib } from "external-lib";

import { useQuery } from "@smart-tv/query";
import { Button } from "@smart-tv/ui";

import { localUtil } from "./utils";
import type { Props } from "./types";

import "./styles.css";
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests for specific package
cd packages/player
pnpm test
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features
- Aim for high code coverage
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Use descriptive test names
